# Scheme Droid [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ddasilva/scheme-droid.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ddasilva/scheme-droid)

Scheme Droid is a REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) Scheme interpreter for Android. [Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) is a minimalist, multi-paradigm dialect of Lisp. Scheme Droid is powered by an enhanced version of the [JScheme](http://jscheme.sourceforge.net/jscheme/main.html) Library.

Scheme Droid is [available on the Google Play Store](https://market.android.com/details?id=net.meltingwax.schemedroid&hl=en).

# Building

To build and install onto your device, first set the ``$ANDROID_HOME`` environmental variable and then execute the following commands. Building on Windows is not currently supported.

    $ make jscheme
    $ make
    $ make install

**Eclipse and ADT users** only need to execute ``make jscheme`` once, and then may use the integrated compilation and deployment tools in their IDE.
